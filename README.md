# Car Price Predictor Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting car prices. The model is trained on a dataset of historical car prices and various features such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, and condition.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, you can find a sample dataset for testing purposes in the `data` folder. The dataset contains the following columns:

- `price`: The target variable representing the car price (in dollars).
- `make`: The car's manufacturer.
- `model`: The car's model.
- `year`: The year the car was manufactured.
- `mileage`: The mileage of the car (in kilometers).
- `condition`: The overall condition of the car (e.g., excellent, good, fair).
